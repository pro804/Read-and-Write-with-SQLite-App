# Read-and-Write-with-SQLite-App

This project is a simple React Native app that demonstrates how to read and write data to a SQLite database. The app uses the Expo framework and the Expo SQLite library to interact with the database.

The app has two main features:

1. It allows users to add new users to the database.
2. It displays a list of all users in the database.

The app uses a SQLite database to store the user data. The database is stored locally on the device.

The app is built using React Native and the Expo framework. It uses the Expo SQLite library to interact with the database.
The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, with user-friendly icons for a better user experience. It is intended as a demonstration of how to use SQLite with Expo and React Native. I noticed that the new release of Expo caused a lot of confusion for new learners like me, so I hope this example will help them.

## Installation

To install the app, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the project directory.

## Running the App

To run the app, run `npm start` in the project directory. This will start the Expo development server and open the app in your default web browser.

You can also run the app on a physical device or emulator by using the Expo app on your device.
